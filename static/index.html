                    <strong>
                        You are seeing every work of art, every idea, every
                        thing, etched onto a single square.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it may be hard to make out all the details from
                    your vantage. After all, to fit everything on a finite
                    canvas you must paint with a very fine brush.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You could squint, but there's no need to strain your eyes.
                    Simply zoom in to observe the smaller details of the canvas.
                    Zoom in far enough and you might even find yourself.

                        <strong>The Universal Canvas...</strong>

                    <ul>
                        <li>has a finite area, but is infinitely detailed.</li>

                        <li>
                            can be cut into any number of pieces, and each one
                            will still contain every image of every resolution.
                        </li>

                <p>
                    You may not believe me. After all, it's easy to make claims
                    about pseudo-random patterns that 'make sense', but don't
                    have any actual backing (see "every sequence of digits
                    exists in pi").
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there's no need to trust me. I understand that this is
                    hard to believe, that's why I added the image search
                    feature. Just load any image and I will figure out where it
                    is in the canvas and zoom in on it for you.

                <h2>How is an 'image' defined?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Universal Canvas is not made up of pixels. However, the
                    canvas can be rendered to pixels. Every pixel in a rendering
                    of the canvas corresponds to a specific square region of the
                    canvas, and the pixel's color is the average color of the
                    square region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An image existing at a given resolution means that there is
                    a region within the canvas, that, when rendered at said
                    resolution, would produce the same pixels as the original
                    image.
                </p>

                <h2>How am I running this on my computer?</h2>
                <p>
                    So, I've gone on about how the Universal Canvas has infinite
                    detail and contains infinite information, but at the end of
                    the day there needs to be some way to simulate it without
                    actually doing infinite computation and storing infinite
                    data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The core principle that the implementation of the canvas
                    relies on is subdivision. The canvas is a square, which can
                    be split into 4 squares, which can be split into 16 squares,
                    etc. As we subdivide the canvas we refine the detail of the
                    rendered colors. We start with a single solid color, then
                    find the 4 colors that compose it, then find the colors that
                    compose those colors, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The key to making this technique work is the subdivision
                    function, whose implementation hides the real magic behind
                    the algorithm. But for now, we can just focus on
                    <em>using</em> the function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The subdivision function takes a color, state, and a square
                    region, and outputs 4 colors and 4 states. The 'state' is
                    just a blob of data that the subdivision function uses to
                    store information it needs on successive subdivisions. The
                    'square region' is a region of the canvas that can be
                    produced by recursively subdividing the full canvas into
                    quadrants. The outputs of the function are the colors and
                    states of the 4 quadrants composing the input square region.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The square region covering the whole canvas is given a
                    hardcoded color and state to use as the first input for the
                    subdivision function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, once you have this subdivision function, you can render
                    any rectangular region of the canvas as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Create a set of square regions that contain a color and
                        a state. The set should initially contain a single
                        square region covering the entire canvas, whose color
                        and state is hardcoded.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Remove all regions from the set, subdivide them, and add
                        the new subdivided regions to the set. Filter the set by
                        removing all regions that don't overlap with the region
                        you want to render.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let <var>n</var> be 5 or the number of pixels you wish
                        to render, whichever is larger. If the set contains less
                        than <var>n</var> regions, repeat the previous step.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Render the square regions in the set to the screen, each
                        one mapping to a square of solid color (pixel).
                    </li>
                </ul>
